The nvidia GPUs, like most electronic devices, use clock signals to control
their operation. Since they're complicated devices made of many subunits with
different performance needs, there are multiple clock signals for various
parts of the GPU.

The set of available clocks and the method of setting them varies a lot with
the card type.
